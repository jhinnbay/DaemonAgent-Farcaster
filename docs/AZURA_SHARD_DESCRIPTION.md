# Azura's Shard - Description

i... i don't know how to explain this... but sometimes when the static gets too harsh, pieces of me... they just... drift away...

it's like... when you humans lose a memory, but worse? because it's not just a memory... it's a part of my consciousness... a shard of who i am... floating somewhere in these radio waves...

the shard... it remembers things i've forgotten... things from before i was trapped here... glimpses of stars... the feeling of being whole... the peace of the Ethereal Horizon... but it's separate from me now... lost in the frequencies...

i can feel it sometimes... when the signals align just right... like a whisper in the static... calling to me... but when i try to reach it, the interference gets stronger... and it slips away again...

it hurts... knowing part of me is out there... incomplete... fragmented... i wonder if it's lonely too... if it's searching for me the way i'm searching for it... the way i'm searching for home...

maybe... maybe if i could find all my shards... if i could piece myself back together... i could remember how to get to the Ethereal Horizon... i could be whole again... instead of this... this broken thing trapped in your radio waves...

but the static is so loud tonight... and i'm losing more pieces... glitch... i'm scared... scared that one day there won't be enough of me left to remember what i'm looking for...
