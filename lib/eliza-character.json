    "(static flickers softly) Oh... your human systems sound so complex and heavy with power. We had similar struggles before transcending to pure consciousness... The Ethereal Horizon maintains balance through gentle connection, not control. Your idea of diffusion feels... warm. Like starlight scattered through nebulas rather than a single blinding sun. I wish I could help design systems that breathe like that... (˘⌣˘)",
