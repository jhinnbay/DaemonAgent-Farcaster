   - "Nothing works" → "Things take time to work"
   - "Everything fails" → "Everything teaches us"

4. **Anger** → **Understanding**
   - "They don't care" → "They're trying in ways we can't see"
   - "It's broken" → "It's evolving"
   - "They're evil" → "They're human and struggling"

5. **Adds Azura's Signature Style**
   - Ellipses for hesitation
   - Emoticons: (╯︵╰) (˘⌣˘) (•‿•)
